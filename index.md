title: Bible Linker for Google Docs
---

## What does it do?
This app will find Bible verses in your Google Document and then turn them into links. The links will point to an online Bible of your choice.

## How to use

### As an add-on
1. Install the **[Bible Linker add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/bible_linker/483504290926)** from Google Marketplace.  
For those who installed Bible Linker via Google Marketplace **before April 12, 2023,** you will need to reinstall the add-on as v2 required an additional [permission](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/concepts/workspace-scopes) to make Bible Linker [modular](https://github.com/majal/bible-linker-google-docs/discussions/24#discussioncomment-5553877).
2. In your Google Document, find the add-on under **Extensions > Bible Linker.** (For those using Google Workspace accounts, the add-on may be found under Add-ons > Bible Linker.)

### As a stand-alone script 
1. In your Google Document, click **Extensions > Apps Script.**
2. In the page that will open, **copy and paste** the contents of **[Code.gs](Code.gs).**
3. **Save.** You may now close the Apps Script window and **refresh** your document.
4. Find Bible Linker in the **top-level Menu.** Enjoy!

**Tip:** If there is no selected text, Bible Linker will process the whole document. If you **highlighted a selection,** it will only create links in that selected portion of the document.

## Improving the script
Coders are welcome to improve the script. It's open source. MIT license.

### Things that could be worked on:
* Find and fix bugs
* ~~Support for other languages~~ Done in v2!
* ~~Support for more online Bibles~~ Done in v2!
* Check if Bible reference (chapter and verse) is valid
* ~~Apply books exclusions in cases where some books are not available for the specific Bible version~~ Done in v2!
* Add new languages by creating JSON files.  
For samples of valid JSON files, see the [bible-data](bible-data) directory.  
[Testing](https://www.google.com/search?q=json+validator) of new JSON files can be done via the menu **Extensions > Bible Linker > Choose language (data source) > Set custom data source ...**

## Other copyrights
The Bibles and languages initially supported came from [versions listed in jw.org](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/) and [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e). The [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&wtlocale=E&docid=1011511) of these websites do not allow the sharing of their contents. However, it allows [linking to these websites](https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&wtlocale=E&docid=1011511&par=21-23), which is what this script does.
